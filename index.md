*Engineering Student at **IMT Atlantique**, France, currently in exhange abroad at **UCSD**, USA.*

I'm 23 years old, coming from Guidel in Britany, France. I'm an engineering student at IMT Atlantique, Brest, France. Currently doing a semester exchange abroad in UC San Diego, CA, United States.

I'm looking for an end-of-studies internship but it could also be an international volunteering in business. I'd to do data science and computer science in a company where I could learn a lot about a new field or business.
